# Mobile Tennis Analysis
For my Masters Dissertation, I was tasked with developing a multi-device Mobile Tennis Analysis System. This project was hinged on the idea that multiple mobile phones positioned on each tennis post could provide a more complete outlook of a given Tennis game. For this, C++ and OpenCV were used to build the application, with Python used to build a custom ground truth generation tool.

## Features
- Tennis Court Detection, within each view.
- Tennis Ball tracking, in each view of the court.
- Construction of a bird's eye view, using features gathered from each of the individual views.
- Bounce detection in each individual view, as well as in the bird's eye view.
- Final visualisation of bounces throughout the court.
- Custom testing tool, implemented using OpenCV in Python and C++.

## Notes
I have decided to not include the source code for this project. Mainly for the reason that if anyone attempts to run it, they will require video footage taken in the correct format that was decided upon for this project. While it would be cool to have a shareable project where anyone can test their own footage, this is simply not possible for the implemented system.

In this repository, I have included the .tex and final PDF, as submitted to my supervisor.
