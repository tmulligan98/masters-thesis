# Mobile Tennis Analysis
For my Masters Dissertation, I was tasked with developing a multi-device Mobile Tennis Analysis System. This project was hinged on the idea that multiple mobile phones positioned on each tennis post could provide a more complete outlook of a given Tennis game. For this, C++ and OpenCV were used to build the application, with Python used to build a custom ground truth generation tool.

## Features
- Tennis Court Detection, within each view.
- Tennis Ball tracking, in each view of the court.
- Construction of a bird's eye view, using features gathered from each of the individual views.
- Bounce detection in each individual view, as well as in the bird's eye view.
- Final visualisation of bounces throughout the court.
- Custom testing tool, implemented using OpenCV in Python and C++.

## Notes
The final report was written in Latex, using the tool Overleaf.
In this repository, I have included the final PDF, as submitted to my supervisor.
